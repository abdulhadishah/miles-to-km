# 📏 Miles to Kilometers

A simple desktop converter built using Python Tkinter. Users can enter a distance in miles and instantly convert it to kilometers using a clean graphical interface.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Python`
- `Tkinter`

## 🚀 Features

- Graphical user interface for unit conversion
- Text input using entry widgets
- Button-triggered calculation
- Dynamic label updates
- Clean, minimal layout using grid

## 📍 The Process

This project was built as **Day 27 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course and served as an introduction to building GUIs with Tkinter.

The focus was on creating windows and labels, configuring window properties, and understanding how widgets work in Tkinter. This included working with entry fields, buttons, and labels, as well as understanding default values for optional arguments.

The project also helped reinforce how `*args` and `**kwargs` work in functions, since Tkinter widgets rely heavily on positional and keyword arguments. Different layout managers were explored, including `pack()`, `place()`, and `grid()`, with `grid()` being used here for more precise control.

## 🚦 Running the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the script: `python main.py`  
3. Enter a value in miles  
4. Click **Calculate** to see the result in kilometers
